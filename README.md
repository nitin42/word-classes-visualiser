## What is it?

A small tool based on [Compromise](https://github.com/spencermountain/compromise) to visualise the different [word classes](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/word-classes-and-phrase-classes) from the english grammar.

## How does it work?

Using the input text, it generates an interactive tree graph which shows a hierarchy of different word classes, and also some useful information like [derived forms (conjugates)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_conjugation).

## About the graph

Each and every part of the graph is interactive, which means:

- You can drag the whole graph anywhere.

- Scroll up/down within the graph container to scale up/down.

- Click on each node. Every node in the graph is interactive and can be clicked.
